## Behave framework with a basic example

A basic usage of the behave framework in Python.

Writing feature tests in Behave is really easy and fun. Just have a check on what I've written.

### Setup

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` before you try to run the following command.

`behave --no-capture`

~WIP.
